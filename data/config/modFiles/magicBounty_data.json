It's an extremely rare sight to find a job offer from someone seemingly affiliated with the VIC in broad daylight in these sorts of networks, but here we are, even if the client tries to hide their tracks as much as possible and label themselves as \"anonymous benefactor protecting corporate interests\". Perhaps, the corp's own hands are too full of other things to take care of? Or someone does indeed wish to earn the Conglomerate's favour by such means for whatever reason. Or perhaps there is something to else to it? Nonethelss, no matter what the truth is, the reward looks enticing enough to consider the offer. \n\"A not really promising documentary series filmmaker $name from Chicomoztoc has been building $hisHerTheir questionable publicity by portraying the VIC in an unfavorable light, using, as $heSheThey say, \"extensive anonymous interviews\", \"confidential footage\", and the so called \"leaked corporate plans\". As one can easily imagine, almost all of it is just a crude re-interpretation of what's already been openly stated by the megacorp's Public Relations Department long time ago. However, the whole ordeal still hurts the image of their partnership with the Hegemony and sows the seeds of distrust among the populace, and I'm sure you can agree that no one needs even more discord around than we all have nowadays. Normally it wouldn't take long for the production to get shut down and the documentary being justly branded as public defamation, but for some unexpected reasons, the process is being a bit too slow, and the reputation of the Conglomerate is yet to be protected adequately.
