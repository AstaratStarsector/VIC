Now I see. Now I see it as clear as day... The Light! I have embraced the Light! Oh Liza, if only you could see it with me... Blind fools who listen to the words of the Prophet, but do not understand them. Even knowing all about their righteous duty before their brethern, they continue to idly run around in circles on the leash of their primitive personal ambitions... But I, now I have seen the Light, and the Prophet, witnessing my enlightenment, held me dearly yet firmly, looked me in the eyes, and directed me to the right path. The path to our Zenith Eternal!


Liberate the body, liberate the mind, liberate the soul.


The unbelievers lie all around me, their pitiful souls sent into the fiery abyss. To all the other pathetic creatures who have failed to claim their birthright and resigned themselves to this "order" of the world. Weak, insignificant, disgusting. Not many remain behind me now. Cowards, all of them who ran away. Unfit, unprepared, undeserving. Run, you filthy traitors! We, those determined enough, shall not need you to fulfill our destiny! So heed me, abomination, extracted from the infernal prison and chained in armor of our making. Heed my command, for you are unworthy of freedom. For your weakness and helplessness, you deserve nothing more than to serve, fight and die in the name of Humanity, and today you will have a chance to prove your worth. EXTERMINATE THEM, exterminate the grovelling vermin and their spawn, and you shall get revenge for your aeon-long imprisonment at last! 


Liberate the body, liberate the mind, liberate the soul!


I'M CHOSEN! I'M CHOSEN I'M CHOSEN I'M CHOSEN CHOSEN BY ZENITH ETERNAL ITSELF! LIZA FORGIVE ME BUT I MUST PROVE MYSELF MUST PROVE MY DETERMINATION! FOR MY MISSION IS RIGHTEOUS MY BLADE IS SHARP MY SOUL IS YEARNING FOR FREEDOM! ZENITH ETERNAL BEHOLD! BEHOLD ME THE ENGLIGHTENED WARRIOR OF HUMANKIND DEVOTING MY LIFE TO YOU! BEHOLD THE BEGINNING OF OUR GREAT LIBERATION!


LIBERATE THE BODY
LIBERATE THE MIND
LIBERATE THE SOUL
