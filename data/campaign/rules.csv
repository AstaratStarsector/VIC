I know they've been looking forward to seeing what you're made of (quite literally), so this should come as a fantastic development. I might even get promoted for bringing them some of your organs! So, why, exactly, did you want to collect on your own bounty? Did you have family you wanted to make the payout to?

I’m sorry, you aren’t here to turn yourself in and collect on your bounty? You want to be commissioned with the Conglomerate?!?""

The representatives stares at you incredulously, then breaks out into about twenty seconds of uninterrupted, boisterous laughter. They do not give you the courtesy of even slightly trying to hide it.

""Oh dear, oh dear. I’ll be frank with you: the only thing preventing me from personally dragging you back to headquarters in multiple, still-living pieces is that it takes a while for the launch authorization forms to process. If you don’t want that to happen, I suggest you leave. Quickly.""",,
CMSNTextHasOther_vic,CMSNTextHasOther,"$faction.id == vic",,"""I would recommend you reconsider your application. It seems you already have a commission with $theOtherCommissionFaction, which would be an immediate violation of your contract, should we accept you. This wouldn’t be a problem for us, per se, but it would activate the standard breach-of-contract clause. I’m not allowed to divulge the details of this clause due to a company-wide NDA, but save to say it would be… invasive. Feel free to return when you are without any such unfortunate legal obstacles.""",,
CMSNTextUnsuited_vic,CMSNTextUnsuited,"$faction.id == vic",,"""Hmm, it seems you don’t have enough VolkovPoints accumulated on your profile to qualify for a commission. Don’t feel bad, though, you can accumulate more by purchasing some of our many genetic modification therapies. Visit one of our soothing gene spas, perhaps? You’ll feel 30 years younger afterwards (and, biologically speaking, you will be)!

If you for some reason don’t find yourself currently in need of improvements--don’t worry, you will in time--, you can always acquire more points by participating in VIC’s Fair Competition program, where we pay you to adjust certain opposing parties’ asset portfolios in our favor while improving the sector's economic growth. For more information, please visit our Asset Adjustment office, which you can find under the directory for ‘bounties.’""",,
CMSNTextSuitedPart1_vic,CMSNTextSuitedPart1,"$faction.id == vic",,"""Fan-tastic! It seems your Net Benefit Assessment score was in the highest quartile - you have an amazing profile here. As a side note, did you know you’ve accumulated enough VolkovPoints to qualify for a free cellular manicure? You should really spend those soon, they expire at the end of every cycle.

Down to business, then: you want to be commissioned. What does this entail, you ask? Well, here at the Volkov Industrial Conglomerate, we have a vision for the sector. You hear a lot in our advertisement about ‘making the future’ and ‘paradise.’ Now, the marketing department may not really believe in those things, but I do. It’s been more than 200 cycles since this sector collapsed, and we haven’t survived on empty promises.

I’ll be frank: the sector doesn’t have the assets left to transform the scant selection of technically-habitable planets into places where humans can thrive. Eridani-Utopia is long dead around these parts. But, we here at VIC do have the technology, and the drive, to make humans that can thrive here, more so than even on the fabled old Earth. Your job would be to help the Conglomerate achieve this goal.

It won’t always be clean; as a Volkov commission-holder, you may be asked to kill, to assassinate, to invade, to destroy the competition. But I can promise that everything you do for us is in service of helping VIC secure a better future for humanity.""",,

Note that this contract includes the standard provision where we retain the rights to your genetic profile in perpetuity, but that shouldn’t be a problem. This right would be retained if you were to exit the contract, which you’re free to do so at any time, not that you would want to. Please submit your identity verification where indicated, and we can get to work.""",,
CMSNTextWelcomePart1_vic,CMSNTextWelcomePart1,"$faction.id == vic",,"""Welcome to the family! I have a feeling you’re going to love your time at VIC.

Do take advantage of the 25% employee discount to all genetic services. Try the new face you’ve been thinking about. Get a new skin texture. Have the body you always wanted. Go nuts!""",,

Even though you aren’t an employee, I should remind you that you’re still contractually obligated not to share any of the company details I’ve divulged here. I’d stick to that contract; the penalties for breaching it are… unpleasant, to say the least.""",,
CMSNResignAskToConfirm_vic,CMSNResignAskToConfirm,"$faction.id == vic",,"The manager places their head in their not-quite-a-human-hand, and sighs heavily.

""Are you certain you want to do this? You should know that former employees are not exempt to VIC 'testing campaigns.' I’d strenuously urge you to reconsider your resignation. The patrol supervisors have been known to show a certain… vindictiveness to ex-employees.""",,
CMSNResignConfirmed_vic,CMSNResignConfirmed,"$faction.id == vic",,"""Very, very unfortunate, but we will survive your resignation. Make no mistake, VIC will bring the future to the sector. I can’t understand why you wouldn’t want to be a part of it, but perhaps paradise isn’t for everyone. We’ll keep your genetic profile on hand, to know what to avoid from now on.""",,
