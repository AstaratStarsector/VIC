#Factions,,,,,,
vic,FACTION,"A core remnant of a ginormous Domain-era megacorporation, now reduced to but a mere fraction of its past power and glory. The Conglomerate, as it is still colloquially known, while diversifying its businesses far and wide, has always been most focused on aerospace engineering and biotechnologies, both of which help them retain a certain level of independence and protection in the turbulent Persean Sector up to this day. And although the prolonged period of total isolation which started after the Collapse and lasted for almost 200 years has put a heavy toll on the company and its people, their re-integration into the interstellar society with the help of Hegemony has been swift and efficient. 

With many regulations annulled and forgotten over these times, The Conglomerate has moved to the usage of its genetic biotechnologies en masse, abandoning the purity of humanity of many of its employees and citizens for efficiency and comfort. While it has only added to an already impressive number of ideological foes and competitors, this, however, attracted just as many supporters, putting the corporation into a relatively stable position on the political arena. 

And despite the company still recuperating under the wing of Hegemony, its historically infamous ruthlessness begins to show already; newly produced fleets haughtily roaming the Sector, passionate transhumanism speeches being given to the populace, and the gaze of the leadership setting hungrily on ever bigger goals.

#fighters,,,,,,
vic_shabriri,SHIP,"VIC-F11 ""Shabriri"" is a blindingly-quick intercepter drone design. Fast, cheap, and numerous, Shabriris were designed as an attempt to compete with common Wasp drones, and to supplement VIC's general lack of point defense emplacements, even despite the Conglomerate's strict, Domain-like policy on automated war machines and artificial intelligences. ",,,,
vic_asmoday,SHIP,"VIC-F25 ""Asmoday"" is a ""Shturmfighter"" - the designation VIC uses for what might be more commonly classified as a corvette. Armed with a Rarog Atomic Emitter, two autocannons, and even a pair of Laidlaw Mass Drivers, the Asmoday is truly a prince among strike craft, able to singlehandedly destroy wings of fighters or pressure full-sized warships. This turned out to be an unpleasant surprise for the Dassault-Mikoyan Engineering forces during the second phase of the Cloud Wars, and upscaled the carnage to the point where both corporations started preparing cruiser and capital class ships for the full-blown war. After that, the Domain officials finally stepped in to stop the unraveling conflict which already engulfed several planets and could prove to end up quite a disaster for the local populace.",,,,
vic_sonneilon,SHIP,"VIC-F04 ""Sonneilon"" is VIC's distinct take on a bomber wing. Rather than using missiles, Sonneilons use a fusion charge to turn a metal projectile into many plasma shards and propel them at high speed at a target. The resulting impact is often enough to overwhelm shields and shred armor, making the Sonneilon a wing that inspires much hatred in those who have survived its barrage. It is somewhat fast for a bomber, but comes with no secondary armaments, so escort craft are recommended.",,,,
vic_uvall,SHIP,"VIC-F33 ""Uvall"" is a heavily-armed and effective interceptor. Rumours persist that Uvall pilots have been genetically modified to experience limited precognition, such is their effectiveness in shutting down enemy ordnance and strike craft. Though of limited use against larger enemy ships, the Uvall is truly a premium alternative to Shabriris.",,,,

#frigates,,,,,,
vic_nybbas,SHIP,"VIC-X04 ""Nybbas"" - ""The Manager of Dreams,"" also dubbed ""The Weaver of Nightmares"" by both its pilots and those who face it in battle. Going beyond all reasonable, this unusual phase hyperfrigate at its core is nothing more but a giant chain of energy systems powering its weaponry, phase coils and teleportation drive. 

Created a couple of years prior to the Collapse as the ultimate ""hunter-assasin"" vessel, the Nybbas project is a great example of why the design bureau should never be given too much budget and freedom in decision-making.

Attempts to fit so much into the smallest possible hull led to the fact that Nybbas is almost completely devoid of any armor, storage, or even crew accomodation; the only logistics consideration was fuel capacity - less than any other Volkov ship. Huge amplitudes of energy surges during flight and active fighting make this ship absolutely unsuitable, dangerous, and sometimes even fatal for long-term piloting.

All crews unlucky enough to be assigned to Nybbas frigates are advised to take significant doses of painkillers and should immediately report any psychological or physiological abnormalities after prolonged combat operations.",,,,
vic_pruflas,SHIP,"VIC-S75 ""Pruflas"" - ""Discord Provoker,"" a reconaissance frigate of novel design with paper-thin armour but unmatched mobility and decent firepower. 

Not entering the service until after the Collapse, Pruflas frigates are the fastest vessels at the megacorp's disposal. Their spectacular speed and impressive fuel-to-distance consumption ratio secured their role not only of the main scouting units, but also of the VICES Department's (VIC Exclusive Solutions) courier ships, capable of quickly delivering valuable information and the so-called ""special gifts"" to the Hegemony's officials, pirate warlords and higher-ups of many other both major and minor powers of the Sector. In many cases such generous signs of goodwill still do not ensure proper cooperation between the addressees and the Conglomerate, but usually it's just enough to forge more stable relations with the higher echelons and to prevent full-fledged military confrontation, even if hatred and disgust towards the megacorp might remain in their fullest among the general population. ",,,,
vic_kobal,SHIP,"VIC-B19 ""Kobal"" - ""Killing Joke"" was an early testbed for VIC's Adaptive Assault Configuration system, later seen in the Samael and Thamuz classes. Noticing that standard Accelerated Ammo Feeder and High Energy Focus systems were ill-suited to the hybrid mounts dominating Volkov design doctrine. The Adaptive Assault Configuration is essentially both systems fused together with a single power source between them, to which energy is automatically allocated based on the ship's equipped weapons. Efficiency is lost, however, when weapons are split between ballistic and energy types.

Classified as a heavy frigate, the Kobal-class is powerfully armed, and has the structural integrity to fire its weapons without shaking itself apart while its system is active. It lacks, however, any point defense weaponry, making it vulnerable to attack craft and flanking enemies. This particular oversight became extremely obvious in the first half of the Cloud Wars between VIC and the Dassault-Mikoyan Engineering, with hundreds of the Conglomerate's pilots falling victim to the nimble white-blue fighters. ",,,,
vic_xaphan,SHIP,"VIC-A01 ""Xaphan"" - ""Diabolical Stoker,"" an aggressive ship with a long history that has undergone several significant alterations throughout its service to the Conglomerate. Embodying the entire essence of the military doctrine of the megacorporation (fragile aerodynamic body, powerful shield and flux dissipation systems, high maneuverability and concentrated frontal firepower), Xaphan is currently one of the most mass-produced vessels of the VIC and often takes the spotlight in numerous air parades.

Like the Kobal-class before it, Xaphans are lacking in point defense. The increased stress from ""Hellfire"" weapons system doubles their logistical cost to install, thus it only has the space to fit smaller weapons. While this may seem a detriment, many of the weapons it can mount may double as point defense solutions, and its drastically increased agility makes outflanking a much less meaningful threat. When its engines do not provide enough of a kick on their own, pilots can use the onboard Omni-Lunge to dodge heavy incoming fire or to chase down an enemy.",,,,
#destroyers,,,,,,
vic_jezebeth,SHIP,"VIC-C96 ""Jezebeth"" - ""The Queen of Lies"" has a deceptively destructive arsenal at its disposal. Inspired by the late-Domain Sunder, Jezebeths were an attempt to play even further into their strengths. Slightly faster, but noticeably less agile and frailer, the Jezebeth-class is the definition of a glass cannon and is one of the favourites among the Aerospace Corps' middle officer ranks, many of which prefer to stay behind the frontlines and let their subordinates do the heavy lifting instead. 

The Jezebeth project almost hit a dead end when VIC aerospace engineers realized that, unlike the earlier Samael-class, Jezebeths wouldn't have the structural integrity to handle the Adaptive Assault system, especially with its upsized armaments. Fortuitously, clandestine Volkov efforts were able to ""recover"" an intact Afflictor-class phase frigate around this time. While the phase cloak technology itself would go into the Nybbas project, the modified phase coil array proved to be possible to mount to the Jezebeth prototype hull--much too small to bring the destroyer into p-space, however. The Entropy Amplifier serves much the same role as a damage-increasing system, but causes much less strain on the hull. Removing the Adaptive Assault system allowed them to upscale the integrated drone bay to a full-sized modular wing bay, dramatically increasing its potential versatility. The resulting hull is among the most dangerous in the sector for its deployment cost.",,,,
vic_samael,SHIP,"VIC-B49 “Samael” - “Angel of Death” is a heavier model of a destroyer created out of necessity after admirals noticed the Moloch’s lack of staying power while holding a battleline. The Samael, in comparison to its much more agile peer, boasts improved armor plating, wider shield angles, superior point defense suite and wider turret firing angles to allow for better engagement of multiple threats. 

Further playing into this, VIC engineers replaced the Moloch's Omni-Lunge--much more suited to aggressors and flankers--with the newer Adaptive Assault Configuration, adapted from the Kobal. While its forbear hull had a notable weakness to enemy strike craft, the Samael-class is capable of mounting a full array of point defense weaponry.

Despite Samael's relatively simple design, the engineers involved in its creation kept claiming that the process was, quote, ""as messy as Mr. Volkov's favourite hairstyle"", and involved failing deadlines, a significant amount of crunches and possibly even some abuse of psycho-stimulating substances in dire moments of designing crisis. ",,,,
vic_moloch,SHIP,"VIC-A33 ""Moloch"" - ""Bull King,"" a strikingly aggressive destroyer, set the standard for all Volkov Industrial Conglomerate hulls to come, mainly the now-mandatory atmo-travel solutions. The first 100% in-house design manufactured by the newly acquired Karzenlicht Luft-Raum Inc., the Moloch-class also introduced the Omni-Lunge system. While it was designed to fly in atmosphere, the aerospace division worried that, if it were forced to land, lift surfaces alone would be insufficient for it to take off, especially with the unlikelyhood of ground terrain being suitable for takeoff. They thus reinforced the maneuvering jets and introduced additional fuel for an afterburner-like effect, similar to plasma jets but with an omnidirectional effect, making the craft VTOL-capable.

Combat crews quickly realized the utility of the Omni-Lunge system in the battlespace, drastically increasing the ship's evasive and pursuit abilities, and their respectable weapons complement make them a credible threat. Molochs are nimble and aggressive; though they lack any rear-facing point defense, few ships are able to outmaneuver them to capitalize on this.

In addition, it was with the Moloch that the long history of the (in)famous Aerospace Corps began. While the Conglomerate's pilots serve as one of the main tools of corporate propaganda and are righteous heroes in the eyes of the public, other departments treat them with thinly-veiled irritation, if not outright contempt. ""Head in the clouds"" - this saying is too well suited to the Aerospace Corps, as their fame-induced pride, arrogant self-centred bravado, and cocky attitudes often get the better of them.",,,,
#cruisers,,,,,,
vic_cresil,SHIP,"VIC-C67 ""Cresil"" - ""The Creeping Corruption,"" one of the oldest Volkov hulls still in service, is dependable enough to remain VIC's primary carrier. Predating the ""aerodynamic design"" doctrine, the Cresil-class, through the installation of viral containment systems, is perhaps much more dangerous to a planet than any atmosphere-capable warship ever could be. The leading project engineer of the time, Miro Honda, regarded Cresil as ""a big step in planetary suppresion methods"", while the secure refrigeration vaults necessary to carry their deadly cargo have given these ships a nickname some employees have complained is problematic and highly inappropriate - ""Ice Cream Trucks"".

Though rumors of viral bombardment ships have led to some enemies of the Conglomerate to conclude that Cresils are logistics ships, nothing could be further than the truth. Despite their weak hulls and subpar flux reactor, Cresils project death just as well as any mainline warship through their extensive modular flight decks. In terms of carrier capacity, the Cresil-class matches the venerable Legion. Fearing their relative fragility, however, Cresils have the ability to recall their wings to defend their mothership, meaning a Cresil is never truly alone.",,,,
vic_thamuz,SHIP,"VIC-B62 ""Thamuz"" - ""Ambassador of Heavy Arms,"" created shortly after the Samael's completion, was VIC aerospace's attempt to supplant the ubiquitous Dominator-class heavy cruiser. Though the Domain admiralty was unimpressed at the time, preferring swifter and more versatile cruisers, the Thamuz-class would quickly prove its worth within Volkov fleets as an implacable dealer of death, the mere rumour of which is enough to make would-be raiders think twice. Though it can't output quite as many missiles as a Dominator and its hull is admittedly weaker, its modern flux reactor, powerful shields, and triple complement of large hybrid weapon mounts make it a force to be feared and reckoned with.

As one of the slowest of all VIC ships, Thamuz, created in an attempt to radically reimagine the established doctrine, has a rather controversial reputation. Scorned by many Conglomerate captains for its awkwardness and clumsiness, heavily armoured Thamuz is nevertheless best at performing where brute force is needed. A powerful Karzenlicht Luft-Raum Inc. fifth-generation reactor, an arsenal capable of competing even with the firepower of far bigger battleships, as well as enhanced protection of the crew quarters make this heavy cruiser a surprisingly comfortable vessel, a flight of which significantly strengthens the formation of modern Conglomerate fleets.",,,,
vic_valafar,SHIP,"VIC-A58 ""Valafar"" - ""The Hunting Lion,"" designed to fill the fast assault role so popular among Volkov admirals, is a simple and brutal warship. Its large spinal hardpoint gives it crushing jaws, and its Omni-Lunge system gives it a deadly pounce. With a supplementary missiles and a solid point defense grid, the Valafar has no real weaknesses to be exploited. As a so-called Shturmcruiser, it is expected to face near the heaviest engagements of any Volkov vessel. As fast as an Aurora, it is easily capable of hunting down destroyers and ripping them to shreds.

Despite its chubby appearance, caused by the need to install a powerful propulsion system (a decision lobbied by the younger, far more vigorous generation of officers), Valafar has won the love of the Conglomerate's crews from the very start of production for its agility in space and amazing smoothness in piloting even in a thick atmosphere. A special kind of entertainment for the pilots was (and still is) flying over enemy positions without using weapons, since the sound wave from the cruiser rushing right above the surface is enough to leave a furrow a couple of dozen meters deep, not to mention the damage to the surrounding infrastructure and the deadly effect on living organisms in the vicinity. Such provocative displays of meaningless brutality are criticized by the higher ranking officers, but in most cases no repercusions are followed.",,,,
vic_focalor_m,SHIP,"VIC-M12MRS ""Focalor"" - ""The Rabid Griffin,"" a versatile twin-configuration combat vessel, this version of which focuses on medium-range missile armament. Relatively low armor protection is compensated by unsurpassed strike potential and impressive mobility, while a powerful built-in weapon is able to effectively keep enemy forces suppressed for a long time.

Known for its mind-boggling missile arsenal and an intimidating prow autocannon, Focalor is an indispensable participant in any Conglomerate planetary operation. The elegant design provides high maneuverability even in the densest of atmospheres, and the powerful armament allows it to easily destroy entire residential areas and extensive fortified areas in a span of minutes. Earning its nickname due to frequent cases of friendly fire, which occur both due to the inaccuracy of the main autocannon and an abundance of trigger-happy gunners, Focalor and its crews often become the victims of particularly strong hatred from the Ground Operations Corps.

Along with Oriax, Focalor was one of the first ships converted from the exploratory vessels of Frontier Dynamics into a tool of war under the commission of the Domain Navy, as the government's bail-out noose around the neck of the bankrupt corporation tightened more and more. Despite the protests of designers and engineers who did not want to participate in the creation of weaponry for the Domain, the project still proceeded to completion, and only a few months later brand-new Focalors took their first bloody part in the suppression of pirate legions and rioting colonies, where they proved their unexpected effectiveness and started earning their grim reputation.",,,,

vic_stolas,SHIP,"VIC-A100 ""Stolas"" — ""Starwalker,"" — a masterpiece of Conglomerate naval engineering, combining a multitude of exotic technologies in a single package. A destroyer’s swiftness with the power of a battleship in its frontal arsenal—in the hands of the aces for whom it was created, Stolas rules the skies and stars, leaving behind only the melted wreckage of those unlucky enough to fall under its blitz. 

The Stolas started as a costly testbed for experimental tech, designed for parades and showcases rather than actual battles. The Collapse irreversibly altered the circumstances that allowed for such a vessel, leading the Conglomerate to drastically and urgently rework their more expensive vessels into actual warships - despite the board’s initial hesitation, said revision did pay out. The aces of the Aerospace Corps were delighted to finally use their vaunted showpiece to dominate the battlefields, while the Central Design Bureau were able to toast to the successes of their brilliant creation. No longer a display piece to sell to the Domain, the Stolas serves a much more important purpose — to help Humanity walk through the cruel starry expanses to its inevitable Liberation.

The initiative to create an “exclusive” vessel for aces received initial pushback even from the majority of pilots in the Aerospace Corps itself. As they saw it, the gap between the rest of the members and the “upper caste” was already beyond all reason, and access to unique technology would only further aggravate the divide. The reality of life for ace pilots, however, is quite different from the glorious story sold to the public and to ordinary pilots; grueling physical and mental training, heavy use of dangerous combat stimulants, and extensive genetic modifications are but a small part of what those who catch the eyes of Academy leadership have to endure. And although the aces had been particularly infamous for their arrogance and bloodlust almost since the Corps’ foundation, it's after the c+180s, that something else began to change within their ranks, as their crews have recently began to note a particularly unhealthy fervor in battle and almost suicidal tendencies among their idols, whose eyes had never shone so brightly and zealously before.

#capitals,,,,,,
vic_apollyon,SHIP,"VIC-A71 ""Apollyon"" - ""The Destroyer,"" a shining symbol of VIC's aerospace engineering, an unusually mobile capital ship for its significant size, equipped with just enough weaponry to obliterate entire enemy fleets on its own. However, due to the design being focused on raw offense and speed, the Apollyon lacks capital-grade armour and is incapable of withstanding focused enemy attacks, even with the help of a powerful shield generator.

Conceived out of spite towards Tri-Tachyon and with the goal of overthrowing the Paragon's reign in the Domain's Navy, the Apollyon project ended up being one of the most ambitious and expensive endeavours in Conglomerate history, with the developement costs nearing the price of a couple of outback planets combined. Unsurprisingly, most of the time and budget were spent on calculating how to apply jet-fighter principles to the hull of such size.

Unfortunately for VIC, and despite all their efforts, the project still didn't manage to make its way into the Navy. The main reason for that - the Collapse happening right in the middle of Apollyon's first official presentation, mere seconds after the prototype turned a Paragon test target into a melted metallic mess to the thunderous applause of the Admiralty's officials. 

To the great delight of the surviving Central Design Bureau, the project wasn't scrapped after the Collapse and eventually entered mass production to serve both as VIC's most potent assault vessel and as one of its main propaganda tools. Nowadays the imposing Apollyon-class shturmcapitals proudly roam the Sector at the head of the Conglomerate's fleets, both playing the role of a compelling argument during numerous diplomatic negotiations and truly living up to their old biblical name in battles. ",,,,
vic_oriax,SHIP,"VIC-U61 ""Oriax"" - ""The Changebringer,"" a highly versatile battlecruiser, counter to the Conglomerate's usual doctrine of extreme specialization. The balanced performance and the ability to install a wide variety of ordnance and fighter systems allows them to successfully integrate into any type of flotilla and serve as a ""binding base"" that allows other ships to unleash their full combat potential in any situation.

A ship with an unusual history, the Oriax was originally created for the predecessor of VIC - the ""Frontier Dynamics"" company. Bearing the name ""Jaeger,"" the ship - conceived as a civilian vessel - was intended to explore the Domain's borderlands, collecting information about potential threats and planets of colonization value. Before the fateful split between the founders of the corporation, the ship managed to pass only the initial blueprinting stage, and was never approved for manufacture. 

After the Domain Navy issued contracts for the development of new warship designs, which VIC lacked at the time. The Central Design Bureau began to review the archival databases in search of suitable projects, so as not to waste time on the first stages of development process. The long-forgotten ""Jaeger,"" distinguished by its ergonomics  and versatility, turned out to be the ideal candidate.

The ship, initially created for peaceful exploration and colonization, was reborn as a full-fledged combat vessel, to be put at the forefront of the expansion fleets. The swift and fearsome Oriax, being able to adapt easily to various threats, were among the first to emerge from the new Gates, dragged forth into the void by the Gate Haulers, bringing the Domain's knowledge and will to yet independent worlds.

Of course, they all had a choice: the choice to accept the new order or perish. Perishing, however, doesn't always come from the smoking barrel of a Domain Battlegroup; occasionally, in exchange for some personal ""services"" and ""products,"" the Domain would grant the Conglomerate permission to deal with the resistance at its own discretion.",,,,
vic_raum,SHIP,"VIC-UH05 ""Räum"" - ""The Ruinous Crow"", an unorthodox battleship with a unique set of artillery weaponry and a distant relation to the reputable Oriax design. Evolved from a weapon testing platform into a proper war vessel in the late pre-Collapse period, it proudly bears its distinguishing mark right on its robust spine. Its Ultra-Heavy armament, although limiting the ship's overall versatility, provides in exchange unparalleled firepower, while the mere sight of planetary defense grade weaponry on the battlefield may strike fear in the hearts of inexperienced enemy officers. 

As the eons-long armsrace between offense and defense schools kept raging amidst the Domain Navy and its contractors, some of its players conceived the plan to put a fine point on it, at least for the foreseeable future of course. To install the largest available weapon systems which no modern and even potential protective measures would work against onto a spaceship and to make it actually work without stalling or spontaneously exploding - the sheer audacity of the concept provided many sleepless nights to the over-ambitious admirals, dreaming about such a magnificent vessel. 

Sensing the possibility of profit, the Conglomerate eagerly volunteered for the project lead post. Despite the loss of trust from certain ruling parties by the time, the megacorp acquired the contract, as the Central Design Bureah has long accumulated a list of sufficiently successful creations for the Navy. Exploiting the fortunate situation to fine-tune and test their new tools of destruction, VIC has set to work. While the number of re-iterations of the vessel's blueprints kept climbing almost to triple digits in futile attempts to fully stabilize the energy grid and to protect the ship's own crew from the aftershocks during fire, the Navy's investigatory departments got interested in whether the whole ordeal wasn't just a massive and convoluted credit-laundering operation between the megacorp and the suspected members of the admiralty. Ultimately, that didn't prevent the finalisation of the project, yet the litigations and numerous media blunders followed by high-profile resignations from both parties didn't leave the ship more than a year of active service before the Gates system fell. Among its feats during that period were forcing an entire raider spacestation to surrender and resolving a long-running riot problem on a mining colony, both times without a single shot, and even today the menacing battleships see more campaigns of intimidation, rather than of actual combat, much to their crewmembers relief.

#unique,,,,,,
vic_stolas_bounty,SHIP,"The flagship of the barbaric pirates' leader. Hidden under the scarred slabs of surprisingly well attached armor and ingeniously replaced parts is a highly sophisticated ship battered with time and warring. It is a miracle that this machine still works in its current form and even manages to outperform your engineers' expectations. Tucked away in its bowels is a set of easily replaceable prow weapons, providing this abomination of a vessel with some extra combat versatility.

More of a walking dead than a proper ship at this point. The insides are a chaotic mess, with entire sections being replaced with older and bulkier elements to keep the systems going. Despite the degraded perfomance and extreme heat and energy outbursts during use, it still keeps going despite everything, as if refusing to stop the carnage started by its original owner. Even the non-superstitious grimly joke about the ship being possessed, and mutilated remains of civilians and various spacers removed from the deep technical compartments do not help the situation. The bridge and living quarters show signs of extensive gunfighting, while the captain's cabin is almost fully covered in unintelligible scribbles and child-like drawings. ",,,,
vic_raum_bounty,SHIP,"A monster, a ""royal palace"", and a mobile base of operations, - this poor Räum-class capital was heavily retrofitted by pirates under the command of ""Rude King"" Fitzroy. As the amount of received damage and additional armor grew over time, so did diminish the reactor's energy output. Eventually, the power systems of the ship could no longer support the original weaponry and engines, and so even they had to be replaced. Luckily, by that time the crew already had enough experience with this mess of a space vessel to make the replacements efficient enough, and so the ever-fearsome Raumpant continues its journey through the void, spreading awe and terror across the Core Worlds, and wild tales across the bars. 

Drunken rumours say that it took at least several Colossi and an unspecified amount of work casualties to finish the work on the ship, and a thorough inspection can indeed point towards such conclusions. The amount of replaced or haphazardly modified parts is absolutely staggering, as even the fighter forge-vats had to be removed, with the large weapon emplacements put into their place as to both ease off the load on a degraded reactor, and to provide more frontal firepower, as is always the tradition among the majority of the ""free peoples"". As the original ultraheavy weaponry was no longer supportable either, to fund further repairs and modifications it was all sold off on the black market, now presumably being used to protect some other warlord's backyard, or taken apart and studied by the VIC's competitors. Unsatisfied by the fact of the forge removal, a brand ""new"" one was ingeniously installed into the stern of the ship, to the delight of the pilots now able to stylishly skim the engines' plumes on every single take-off.

Other modifications included, but not limited to: a training polygon and a shooting range in cargo holds; a mini-zoo for xenofauna and, occasionally, particularly bothersome prisoners; extra weapon emplacements on the main wings; an extra set of escape shuttles for the crew; gold-plated internal coating for the main bridge area; and a sprawling hot jacuzzi pool in the former weapon control unit behind the bridge, heated up by the the primary power highway stretching from the reactor to the main spinal armament area.

#Weapons,,,,,,
vic_heavylaidlawaccelerator,WEAPON,"A slow-firing but accurate weapon that deals devastating damage to hulls near-instantaneously, although it struggles against shields and heavy armour. Explosive expansion of searing plasma on impact can easily scorch secondary targets nearby. Despite the addition of ""heavy"" to its name, the Heavy Laidlaw Accelerator was actually the first such weapon developed, when the Conglomerate faced the need for a powerful weapon system that could easily chew through exposed ship hulls.

Iconic Laidlaw weapons use the so-called ""Laidlaw Effect,"" a Volkov trade secret, to accelerate projectiles to a greater degree than other forms of linear motors, such as coil or railguns. The process has a side-effect of turning a solid metallic projectile into a stream of superheated plasma. Hypervelocity impacts can evaporate large chunks of hull, the explosive burst of which causes additional destruction. Created by ""The Father of VIC tech"", Ernesto Laidlaw, these weapons are used ubiquitously by the Conglomerate, with their sizes ranging from handheld pistols and rifles to enormous planetary siege cannons. ",,,,
vic_capacitonsDischarger,WEAPON,"A short-range arcing tesla cannon, overpowering shields and disabling ships with EMP damage. The Capacitons Discharger is a flux-expensive weapon to fire, but is devastating to shields and arcs to surrounding targets--including missiles and fighters, though it lacks the ability to automatically target the former.

One of the less conventional weapons of VIC, Capacitons Discharger uses the principle of cascade looping of flux reactors. By connecting the energy profiles of the firing ship and its targets with  active shields, the discharger causes monstrous disturbances in the energy systems of both sides, which is almost always guaranteed to quickly end in a blinding overload of one of them. Such an unusual mechanism of action greatly limits the list of platforms on which the Dischargers can be installed and even VIC commanders aren't keen on using this wild beast of a weapon due to its nuances and intricacies.  ",,,,
vic_devastator,WEAPON,"A Volkov weapon inspired by the Devastator Cannon, but with a more offensive focus, the Besomar Scattercannon is a large ammo-fed explosive shotgun. Capable of impressive burst damage, the Besomar strips armor and wrecks smaller ships.",,,,
vic_psotnik,WEAPON,"A medium-range shield suppression autocannon that delivers an impressive amount of EMP payload. Though its individual shots deal little damage, the Psotnik Interference Autocannon fires a hailstorm of them. Despite being kinetic projectiles, the EMP arcing prevents enemy ships from safely absorbing them by turning off their shields.

Surprisingly, the original version of the weapon did not include the use of EMP shells. A significant upgrade, including the installation of an internal magnetic reactor and protective insulation for the targeting systems, took place after the battle in orbit of Nikorus 6, in which the heavily armored rebel ships proved surprisingly effective even against a storm of autocannon shells from the Conglomerate's ships.",,,,
vic_tugarin,WEAPON,"A long-range weapon that, true to its name, launches a miniature star-like plasma sphere, the Tugarin Stellar Catapult literally melts through heavy armor. Flaws in the ""star""'s magnetic containment field, necessary to prevent premature collapse and supernova detonation, apply a force retrograde to its launch vector, gradually slowing the projectile down.

The Tugarin is VIC's deadliest weapon by far - to its own personnel during testing. It was originally planned as an energy weapon that would generate and project tiny stars, however the weapon would have a similar effect to its own casing as it would on enemy ships, violently exploding. Rather than abandoning the project, Volkov engineers decided that the stellar generation technology was too promising, and devised shells that would ignite the fusion reaction after launch, bypassing the problem entirely. The shell-based stellar generators are nearly as potent, but the already-volatile containment field systems proved harder to miniaturize, creating the deceleration problem.",,,,
vic_vodyanoy,WEAPON,"A powerful weapon of suppression and area denial, which is essentially a multi-barrelled high-temperature plasma generator, capable of growing even more destructive as the system's heat levels rise during sustained fire. The resulting hailstorm of incandescent plasma blasts steadily strains enemy shields and turns heavy armor into a glowing red-hot sieve, but the particles quickly lose their destructive power after impact and don't damage inner hull as effectively.

In each of the four main barrels of Vodyanoy, there are three linear accelerators of plasma bolts (facetiously called by the engineers as ""blobs""), which are generated in a relatively small thermonuclear reactor in the main body of the gun. Severe overheating issues with the first single-barrel prototype led to this design, which takes advantage of parallel cooling systems to allow sustained firing. The Central Design Bureau took it upon itself not only to fix the heat problem, but to weaponize it: this enlarged version uses the heat accumulation to increase the destructive power of each shot.

Reportedly, the Conglomerate is actively trying to create miniature versions of this weapon for use by armored vehicles and infantry. However, current test models still show unsatisfactory results, and the whole project is expected to be yet another costly dead end among the wasteful megacorp's many failed endeavours.",,,,
vic_thermalLance,WEAPON,"A heavy beam weapon with truly devastating power, capable of cutting through even the heaviest of armors like a knife through butter. The main disadvantages are limited ammunition and long reload time, but given the fact that few opponents are able to withstand a direct hit of its concentrated atomic ray, these disadvantages can be considered non-critical.

Originating from a series of experiments on the use of controlled thermonuclear reactions (one of the results of which was the creation of the Tugarin Stellar Catapult), the Rubezahl project's main goal was to perfect the thermal resilience of materials and equipment that were later used in the Archangel orbital mining station.

Promoting the project as the ""final nail in the coffin"" of doctrines based on early-Domain technologies and brute armor, VIC thereby sought to increase the demand for more advanced ships and shield systems both in the private sector, and in the Navy. Despite the relative success of this strategy, which would end with Rubezahl becoming obsolete itself as well, even now the Thermal Lance does not lose its relevance, taking into account the mass distribution of low-tech designs throughout the Sector.",,,,
vic_zlydzen,WEAPON,"A non-standard energy support weapon that does not cause serious damage on its own, but severely disrupts the internal systems of the target ship, making it more vulnerable to other threats. In addition, it is also able to affect phase ships, significantly reducing the time they can spend in P-space afterwards.

The main tool of the Conglomerate's inner system patrols, Zlydzens were widely used before the Collapse, and have never lost their popularity among the captains of the Aerospace Corps. The ease of use and the ability to neutralize targets without causing serious long-lasting damage makes it an essential tool for intercept and inspection squads. Despite its seemingly non-violent nature, Zlydzens can also often be found among the arsenals of larger fleets, and even interstellar armadas of the corporation, where they are used for long-range support and weakening enemy targets so that they can be overwhelmed.

Concrete data on the biological effects of the weapon on living organisms still remains mostly classified, but according to both eyewitnesses and the project lead's advisor, Ernesto Laidlaw himself, the result of even a short-period exposure is ""impressive, even if surprisingly gruesome"".",,,,
vic_apocrypha,WEAPON,"The final argument of the Conglomerate's modular weaponry, Apocrypha is a monstrous amalgamation of thermonuclear and antimatter payloads, capable of reducing even the toughest of targets into fine dust. Accompanied by an escort of an anti-PD swarm, the merciless delta level AI delivers fiery death without a nanosecond of hesitation. 

Originally planned to be named ""Marid"" to fit with the chosen weapon naming scheme of the megacorp, Apocrypha had to enter the market with a different name due to legal issues and the name being already patented by another weapon manufacturer. Attempts to circumvent the situation via re-designing, re-branding and generous giftings to both the competitor and the officials did not bring satisfactory results, and the marketing department had to begrudgingly release the product under its secondary name to meet the finances departments' quarterly plans. The reasons why it wasn't changed still, considering how the chance of the competitor's survival has virtually plumetted to zero due to the current circumstances, are undisclosed and remain unknown to the wide public. Leading to the assumptions that the Conglomerate might still be expecting the Domain's return and thus fears the legal repercussions of unlawful product name appropriation.",,,,
vic_falak,WEAPON,"A masterpiece of esoteric weapon engineering designed by Ernesto Laidlaw himself, Falak torpedo makes even the experienced physicists scratch their heads. Seemingly random, yet actually systematic energy fluctuations in the grids of the targets hit by this enigma of a weapon result in a spectacular mix of debilitating electromagnetic pulses and destructive plasma outbursts.

Little is known about the project, the unexpected offspring of which was turned into Falak Flux Collapse Torpedo. While some clues point towards the connection with Oriax Battlecruiser's systems, it is impossible to say for sure without access to the original documentation, zealously guarded by the Central Design Bureau, which has been led by Mr. Laidlaw for many years, including some even before the Collapse. ",,,,
vic_afreet_large,WEAPON,"A heavily upgraded variation of the first generation Afreet, capable of dealing even more damage and actively homing onto the target. The reduced rate of fire and the increased size of the complex as a whole are compensated by vastly combat efficiency.

The logical continuation of the Afreet project, despite its apparent simplicity, required a lot of time and effort from the Central Design Bureau. Due to numerous conflicts with the Admiralty, who believed the old missiles could be made smarter and deadlier without changing their actual size, the development of a new missile system dragged on for many years, and only the death of a particularly stubborn naval officers eventually put an end to the production hell.",,,,
vic_afreet_large_stream,WEAPON,"A heavily upgraded variation of the first generation Afreet, capable of dealing even more damage and actively homing onto the target. The reduced rate of fire and the increased size of the complex as a whole are compensated by vastly improved combat efficiency. This particular version deploys the swarm in a rapid stream.

The logical continuation of the Afreet project, despite its apparent simplicity, required a lot of time and effort from the Central Design Bureau.

,,,,,,
,,,,,,
vic_nawia,WEAPON,"A medium-range kinetic weapon which multiplies its projectiles via the violation (or creative interpretation and twisting) of quantum mechanisms to overwhelm shields. Most effective against slow, large targets. 

The Nawia's projectile exists in a state of quantum uncertainty, occupying many possible locations at any given time. When the projectile impacts against a target, the trigger mechanism keeping it from fully entering reality is destroyed. Due to a quirk of quantum mechanics' interactions with p-space, multiple copies of what are all technically the same projectile appear soon after it, dramatically multiplying the damage of what is still, from a scientific perspectice, a single shell.",,,,
vic_verlioka,WEAPON,"A potent defensive energy weapon based on the same principle employed by the Hyperspace Coherence Adjustment Units. Prolonged powerful waves of disruptive quantum fluctuations are capable of literally ripping smaller entities apart, turning their atomic structure into a chaotic quark mess. The effect on bigger targets if far less prominent, which makes Verlioka relatively useless against anything bigger than a Hound. 

The Conglomerate's crews and ship maintenance personnel are regularly instructed on safety protocols regarding Verliokas, as even a single miscalculation or malfunction in the weapon's systems can result in a rather unpleasant red-tinted scene in a radius of several hundred meters, as well as severe damage to the electronic systems in the vicinity, especially other quantum physics-based contraptions. ",,,,
vic_lightlaidlawaccelerator,WEAPON,"A slow-firing but accurate weapon that deals devastating damage to hulls near-instantaneously, although it struggles against shields and heavy armour. Explosive expansion of searing plasma on impact can easily scorch secondary targets nearby. The Laidlaw Accelerator is essentially a single barrel of the heavy version, delivering crushing blows at unprecedented speeds. 

Iconic Laidlaw weapons use the so-called ""Laidlaw Effect,"" a Volkov trade secret, to accelerate projectiles to a greater degree than other forms of linear motors, such as coil or railguns. The process has a side-effect of turning a solid metallic projectile into a stream of superheated plasma.

Created by ""The Father of VIC tech"", Ernesto Laidlaw, these weapons are used ubiquitously by the Conglomerate, with their sizes ranging from handheld rifles to enormous planetary siege cannons.",,,,
vic_gagana,WEAPON,"A precise medium-range ballistic weapon which fires high-velocity AM-charged rounds. The design of a bygone era, brought back to a new, heavily modernized life by the engineers of the Conglomerate, the Gagana AM Rifle-Cannon is able to easily overcome even heavy cruiser- and capital-grade armour.

Accustomed to fighting technologically advanced competitors, pilots and officers of the Aerospace Corps were unpleasantly surprised by the prospects of meeting with much more primitive and hard-headed opponents in a post-Collapse environment. The Central Design Bureau, already under a disproportionate workload, had to urgently look for a way out. Otherwise, the nimble ships of the Conglomerate would soon be crushed by the ancient armored giants.

Lacking the resources to develop another full-fledged new weapon system, the Bureau's employees focused their efforts on modernizing the blueprints they received from one of the now-long-gone fringe Battlegroups back in the days. The engineers only had to slightly improve the design of an already reliable and robust breech, speed up the reloading mechanism and lengthen the barrel for greater accuracy and shell velocity. The Aerospace Corps warmly accepted the armor-piercing novelty and set off to conquer new horizons, and the time and resources saved by the Bureau were directed to much more promising and important projects.",,,,
vic_OLDgagana,WEAPON,"A medium-range ballistic weapons which fires high explosive smart shells, which have a limited degree of tracking. The Gagana Dart Launcher reliably strips armor and damages hull, and the darts contain a delayed explosive charge, triggered after the projectile burrow into hull.

Though its darts do not have the independent propulsion necessary to classify them as missile weapons, their course corrective quality nonetheless makes them more accurate than standard cannons, and surprisingly effective against fighters.",,,,
vic_psotnikmed,WEAPON,"A smaller version of the Psotnik Autocannon, the Interference Machinegun fills the same role - shield suppression. With its hailstorm of swift EMP-augmented shells, even despite their small size, this weapon can reliably deal with shields, while still being a menace to the un-shielded targets. 

In an attempt to reduce the size of the autocannon for installation on small-class ships, the Central Design Bureau was forced to reduce the caliber of the shells and almost completely redesign the loading mechanism for new characteristics. The results of laboratory and field tests, however, satisfied the officers and the leadership of the Armed Forces Department, and the new weapon soon moved to the stage of mass production.",,,,
vic_vila,WEAPON,"An unusual weapon that combines impressive strength with unnatural accuracy, Vila Impulse Converger is very demanding of its operators, which must perfectly synchronize the highly specific trajectories of its wayward projectiles with the movements of enemy targets, which proved to be a rather difficult task even with the help of modern gunnery systems and implants of the latest generations.

One of the most bizarre and obscure inventions of the Conglomerate, the Vila Impulse Converger is said to have been developed under the personal supervision of Ernesto Laidlaw, head of the Department of Technological Advancement. An acute lack of technical information and a surprisingly long list of safety measures for both the gunners and the maintenance personnel, including regular conduct of obligatory psychological examinations, have created a rather controversial reputation for the weapon.

Classified lists of scientists and engineers involved in the project; elements of the internal structure that work on principles that are not fully understood by most commoners in the Sector; blueprints with numerous obfuscated data packs and built-in self-destruction protocols that are activated in the event of a possible disassembly of the weapon. Whatever is at the heart of this weapon - the Conglomerate clearly made every possible effort to ensure that its mechanism remains secret to the world.",,,,
vic_balachko,WEAPON,"A potent energy weapon designed to bring down all of the enemy's layers of defences in a blink of an eye. Impressive effectiveness against both shields and armour is offset by rather modest effects on the structural integrity of the targets, making the users of the weapon dependant on other means to finish off their opponents. 

A result of an accidental discovery, Balachko Cryoheat Generator was designed and put into production after an explosion on board of one of the Conglomerate's chemicals tankers back in the days. Numerous reports of the surviving members of the scattered logistical fleet allowed the corporate scientists to uncover an unusual property of the industrial solution which was transported by the unlucky tanker. When heated to extremely high temperatures, the solution would quickly detoriate most of the solid materials it came in contact; while at the same time, when cooled down to near absolute zero, it would severely disrupt active shield fields. The militarization of the discovery was a matter of several short conference calls. ",,,,
vic_qutrub,WEAPON,"Although lacking any true speciality and not excelling at anything, Qutrub works as a good anti-armor solution in a miriad of scenarios. A universalised platform base allows installation into both missile and ballistic weapon slots, making the homing dart launcher an easy choice for captains with limited options. 

Having gone through several costly redesigns and unfortunate marketing campaign failures, Qutrub was set to gather dust in the mothballed arsenals and obscure weapon museums of the Domain. Yet, with the Conglomerate's new management's sudden order to reinstate all available and potentially useful projects not long before the Empyrean jumppoints' fortunate restoration, Qutrub found itself a new life in the post-Collapse reality. ",,,,
vic_saih_med,WEAPON,"A bigger, meaner and more expensive version of the Saih missile launcher. A powerful blast of several high-mass ultrapolymer shells creates significant disruptions in the shield matrix, while a combination of a high-grade engine and custom AI algorithms swiftly delivers the payload to its addressee. While lacking the raw power and EMP effect of classic Sabots, Saih compensates that with better mobility and faster rate of fire.

Saih series of missiles is regarded with a lot of respect among the megacorp's military, and not without a reason. Being VIC's first missile platform with a built-in autoreplicator, Saih saved a lot of lives in the prolonged frontier campaigns of the Conglomerate during its early days, full of risky missions ordered by the Domain Navy, willing to use its new indebted contractor to the fullest. As the scale of both the operations and the body count of employed mercenaries and prisoners grew, the technology was subsequently copied over to all other megacorp's missile weaponry, becoming a widely advertised schtick even at the expense of other functional advantages.",,,,
vic_hatif_med,WEAPON,"When even entire salvos of other missiles still aren't enough, Hatif always saves the day, especially when it comes in an even bigger version. A militarised homing flare launcher is any PD's worst nightmare, and Hatif lives up to its name's mythological origins. A favourite of captains preferring to play with their prey before finishing it off with a well-timed torpedo launch. 

While many among the navy smirk at the thought of replacing actual missile weapons with the ""useless thing"", statistics do not lie. And in Hatif's case statistics do indeed say, that even a single unit of it can drastically change the outcome of a missile strike. Statistics also say that Hatif was one of the worst selling weapons of the Conglomerate, back when it wasn't yet known as the Conglomerate, and is considered as a not-that-unimportant part of many terrible investments that eventually led to the Frontier Dynamics' bankrupcy. ",,,,
vic_afreet_med,WEAPON,"An upsized version of a cheap but effective means of destroying lightly armored targets, Afreet sends one swarm of rockets after another into the enemy, overcoming their point defenses with the help of sheer number of ordnance. Low explosive yield and fragile hull of rockets is an unfortunate compromise.

Being one of the most common types of missile weaponry not only on spacecraft, but on other military vehiles of the Conglomerate as well, Afreet Swarmer rightfully earned its iconic place in the culture of the megacorporation. A mandatory participant in almost every product of the holomedia of the military genre, this simple and reliable missile system is known and beloved by everyone, even outside the navy and army, be it in art, or in street games of children, imagining themselves as soldiers of the Conglomerate, exterminating the monstrous abominations of Luddism and its Tyrannical overlord.",,,,

vic_hungruf_med,WEAPON,"An old, classic, hefty low-yield nuke in a slightly modernised package - Hungruf efficiently melts the armor off the targets regardless of their size. The engine block remains a valid distraction for the enemy PD even after the warhead detachment. This bigger version includes an even more sophisticated reloading mechanism than the original.

As one of the oldest missiles in the entire Conglomerate's arsenal, Hungruf often receives harsh treatment from the younger navy members. Some do not like its unimpressive speed, the others laugh at its outdated anti-PD system of miniature explosive payloads. By some opinions, when the military nanoforges were restarted back in c+190s after almost two centuries of resource conservation and asset scrapping, Hungruf shouldn't have been brought back. Yet the old man persists, washing the megacorps' adversaries in high-speed particles both in space and on the ground, stubbornly refusing to fall into the trash bin of history.",,,,

vic_strigoy,WEAPON,"A defensive weapon that fires a cluster of proximity-fused fragmentation shells. Effective against missiles and strike craft.

Smaller iterations of this fragmentation cannon are often mounted onto the Conglomerate's heavy exosuit troopers, with little to none competition when it comes to getting rid of the enemy infantry and lightly armoured vehicles. ",,,,
vic_rarog,WEAPON,"An accurate close-range fusion beam which rends through unshielded fighters and lighter armor, the Rarog Atomic Emitter is somewhat unusual for an energy weapon. It is devastatingly effective against unshielded targets. Its good damage and tracking make it an effective PD weapon if an Integrated Point Defense AI is installed.",,,,
vic_laidlawMassDriver,WEAPON,"A slow-firing but accurate weapon that deals devastating damage to hulls near-instantaneously, although it struggles against shields and heavy armour. Explosive expansion of searing plasma on impact can easily scorch secondary targets nearby.

vic_targetingLazer,WEAPON,"A very long-range targeting laser. Does negligible damage, but helps with guidance systems.

As one of VIC's oldest designs, it became apparent over the years that the Cresil's targeting and fire control suites were inadequate for the demands of current warfare. Rather than tear out and redo the ship's innards, it was deemed cheaper and easier to install new systems in an external package.

For some time, VIC have used a different method to locate targets. By attaching virtually undetectable ""beacons"" to objects using the principle of quantum entanglement, ship systems could receive data on the position and direction of targets regardless of distance. One of the experiments showed that such a technology could even be used to create a stable connection even between far-away Sectors. Unfortunately, the use of entanglement along with the use of other quantum effects led to serious energy anomalies, causing critical interference both between the connected ships and and within adjacent devices, which ultimately led to the decision to abandon the technology.",,,,
vic_abyssalfangs,WEAPON,"The Abyssus Array was designed to strain enemy shields or to overload their PD systems before the Apollyon attacks with its primary weapons. Loosely based on the common Squall MLRS, it shoots a salvo of 24 missiles, each holding a powerful shield-disrupting payload.",,,,
vic_scatterblaster,WEAPON,"A short-range strike bomber weapon designed for pummeling its target with energized hail of fire, the Scatter Blaster uses a limited supply of fusion charges to blast its metal slugs into terrifying shards of plasma, able to tear through most any target and equally effective at pressuring shields and shredding hull - which might be the role of an energy missile, but Volkov weapons development has been strangely reticent regarding missiles (some rumors, which the Conglomerate most vociferously denies, say one of the executives in charge of weapons R&D, Plokhoy Drakon, had an embarrassing leak related to a promotional model for an experimental missile, leading to missiles being disfavored at a time due to emotional trauma) - anyway, a lesser-known fact about the weapon is that the Scatter Blaster takes its name from its lead designer, Alfonzo Scatter, an intrepid rising star in the Conglomerate who started with nothing but a dream and a firm belief that one can never include too many fusion charges; the story of Dr. Scatter (he has a doctorate in Art History) has recently been made by the Volkov Marketing Department into a propaganda hyperwave serial designed for comfortable viewing on TriPads, the climax of which involves a shot of the Scatter Blaster firing which COMSEC has unfortunately declared to be ""unfit for citizen viewing"" due to certain symbolic elements which some critics have claimed were deeply revelatory about the director's psyche, based off theories (which the Marketing Department will point out are ancient and discredited) about the personality from an Old Earth psychoanalyst.",,,,
vic_UvalFlagCanister,WEAPON,"Simple, yet effective mine layering system. Contains enough of a load to destroy most missiles in one explosion. A built-in nanoforge allows for continuous barrage, while decently sized ammo racks make it effective againt bursts of enemy fire.",,,,
vic_azhdaya,WEAPON,"A large-caliber rapid-fire autocannon designed to suppress shields. The low accuracy is more than compensated by the unsurpassed rate of fire, and the miniature chemical charges inside the gyrojets provide relatively high efficiency against enemy hulls despite the small caliber. Synchronization with the ship's AI makes it possible for gyrojets to home onto enemy targets, but this is only possible during the activation of the ship's complex targeting system.

Designed primarily to obliterate ground targets and only then spaceships, Azhdaya instills fear even in the soldiers of the Ground Operations Corps, who are firsthand familiar with the roar of the autocannon and the destruction that it sows. A stream of explosive shells from the sky clears block after block in the blink of an eye, and only heavily armored vehicles are able to withstand the deadly rain of the gyrojets. Rumours from the evil tongues are that the Central Design Bureau has been long trying to introduce Azhdaya in a modular form. However, fortunately for everyone, at the moment only Focalors, for which it was initially created, are accompanied by its terrifying roaring.

Whether by chance or by some unspoken rule, Azhdaya's gunners rarely make it back home after having their ships shot down. Even if the safepods are successfully retreived by friend or foe.",,,,

vic_raum_weapon_gagana_ultra,WEAPON,"An obscenely-sized twin cannon firing equally obscenely-sized AM-charged shells with impressive accuracy, and, most surprising of all, decent fire rate. Few ships can stand against the onslaught of its thundering salvos, and even the ancient dreadnoughts clad in layers upon layers of armor find themselves uncomfortable when facing this fearsome weapon.

It wasn't long after the completion of a refurbished Gagana AMR-Cannon that the Central Design Bureau received an order from the upper management to look into possible options for the new armaments for Räum battleships. To make the formiddable vessels more effective against the crude and thought-to-be-obsolete spacefaring chunks of heavy armor, the Bureau's overworked engineers didn't have to look far - all the blueprints required for the new weapon weren't yet shelved away. Upsizing the rather primitive piece of technology took far less time and effort than many feared, and the only hurdle was upgrading the recoil dampening systems, as the sheer force with which the new gargantuan cannons slammed back after shots made the entire bridge and engine areas quake. And if constant tinnitus and concussions of crew members could be disregarded albeit with a steady flow of complaints, the damage to the ship's systems was deemed too critical of an issue. Already struggling to support Ultra-Heavy weaponry from the moment of its very concieval in the delirious minds of the Domain Navy's officers, the battleship would simply disassemble in its rear region after prolonged firing sequences. Of course, the Bureau were not strangers to challenges (especially in the demanding reality of post-Collapse), and by applying their experience, ingenuity and copious amounts of energy foodstuffs, the recoil system problems were mostly solved in a rather quick succession. Alas, the complaining crews would still be required to take medications, or, more preferrably, extensive modifications.",,,,
vic_raum_weapon_strzyga,WEAPON,"It'd be difficult to find a fighter or missile swarm which could get through the hailstorm of flak shells which is the colossal Strzyga. With its wide area coverage and quick rate of fire, none can escape the obliterating wave of shrapnel. And although it's not as effective against heavy armor, its steady volleys can keep the enemy shields occupied for a long time. Usage against surface targets is difficult and officially frowned upon, but not exactly forbidden.

Simple, efficient, robust - Strzyga is the epitome of pure practicality, a rare occurence amidst VIC's designs. Its story begins with an old planetary anti-dropship battery, haphazardly created by the Conglomerate in its post-bankrupt rebranded infancy period, when the first Navy contracts started to show up as the heavy price for the miraculous bailout. Despite the lack of knowledge in proper weapon manufacturing, the newly founded Central Design Bureau managed to create a solid defensive tool which proceeded to have a long run in the hands of the fringe colonies struggling against raiders - a decent enough compromise for the recently reborn megacorp's employees who used to be focused purely on humanitarian solutions for the same fringe settlements. Unfortunately for the Bureau's engineers, it was but one of many instruments of destruction of their making to come.",,,,
vic_raum_weapon_alkonost,WEAPON,"A monstrous apparatus capable of generating enormous amalgamations of plasma-like particles. The resulting ""blob-comet"", for the lack of better term, can sustain its stability outside of the oscillation chamber for only so long, sparking powerful outbursts towards any neighbouring solid mass, before violently unravelling itself and releasing incredible amounts of energy to the outside. The resulting blastwave evaporates the majority of hard matter in the vicinity, while high amounts of radiation make short work of most living organisms even far away from ground zero. 

A magnificent, and utterly terrifying contraption, spreading death and ruin at the Conglomerate's command. No concrete reports have been found on the origins of this weapon, and no data suggests that it has been witnessed prior to the Collapse. Whether a supersecret Domain Navy project, a product of the deranged genius of the VIC's scientific minds, or even an enigmatic piece of non-human technology merely adapted for combat use - the continuous lack of information and even the slightest commentary from the megacorp itself fuels the fire of rumours and conspiracies amidst the TriMedia social communities. What little is known about Alkonost comes from the hazy reports of eyewitnesses, while attempts to disassemble and reverse-engineer the machine inevitably end in gruesome accidents even when it isn't powered by any outer energy source.  ",,,,
vic_raum_weapon_xl_laidlaw,WEAPON,"The beloved of the majority of Raums' captains. A colossus of a particle accelerator, powerful enough to simply punch through all but the toughest of targets. The strain on the grid flux during each shot is immense, but it is a fair price to pay for the incomparable level of destruction this machine brings. 

Sometimes the most efficient solution is indeed the simplest. From the ancient cave-dwelling times humanity knew that a rock thrown fast enough is as good or even better than any convoluted long-brewn poison. Thousands of years later, and this axiom still holds true and supreme. Who needs hyperdimensional streams, quantum lensing, Brane physics and violations of causality, when something as straightforward as a particle accelerator perfected to its ultimate form can provide results far greater and, arguably, more viscerally pleasing. Such was the line of thought for the famous Laidlaw Accelerators, and this gigantic version of it is the final form, the very symbol of that eternal rock-throwing principle's dominance. Shields, armor, planetary crust, nanite-enforced superpolymer, you name it, - Hyperaccelerator will obliterate it if not with one, but with just two shots, as proved during VIC's numerous successful siege operations. 

""Don't listen to all those ignorant nay-sayers. With this, you can absolutely punch a hole into the surface of a planet."" - Ernesto Laidlaw, Technological Advancement Department Director",,,,
vic_raum_weapon_rokh,WEAPON,"A huge missile filled to the brim with proximity-fuse mines, all and each ready to surge forth in every direction upon activation. Its wide area of mine dispersion allows even a single Raum to easily control enormous swaths of space and keep the enemy in, or out of desired territory. A highly-efficient open-type nanoforge quickly prints out new ordnance, making sure that the battleship can hardly ever run out of ammunition during prolonged battles. 

Created as a supplementary test product for the main project which was the gigantic modular nanoforge, Rokh quickly found its purpose as an area-denial and blockade tool, with just a single Raum battleship now capable of walling off an entire colony all on its own. No more carrier groups were needed to be on stand by in the vicinity of a rioting world, as the new ""fire and forget"" isolation method made sure that no vessel could come in or out, dooming the arrogant mutiniers to inevitable resource deficit and, eventually, famine. Other usage cases included such as: shielding the newly-founded Cocytus headquarters of the megacorp, keeping away the Tri-Tachyon sabotage squads from the orbital research facilities, and creating the record-breaking space minefield, both in total size and the number of deployed mines (both values officially documented, entered into the Domain records databases and yet to be surpassed).

vic_raum_weapon_vodyanoy_ultra,WEAPON,"A massive, rapid-fire plasma generator capable of producing a stream of projectiles that are equally effective against both shields and armor. The strain on the flux grid of a ship is noticeable, and internal hull structures of opponents are typically resistant to the relatively small plasma projectiles. However, this weapon has no equal when it comes to suppressive firepower and forces the enemy to sacrifice one or other layer of defences.

An enlarged version of Vodyanoy would've never come to be, had it not been for an overly enthusiastic admiral of the Domain Navy, who was thoroughly impressed by the original's functions. Although the corporation was hesistant to start the work on the project, the generous sponsorship of the highly ranked officer kickstarted the works. The debates on the efficiency and necessity for the giant multibarrelled rotary cannon would continue for years on, dragging even into the times of the post-Collapse among the members of the Aerospace Academy. And yet, Vodyanoy Ultra stays, performing its duty with utmost diligence, reserved, for the most part, for operations against the Luddic Path fleets and for the especially unruly pirates. And those who bear doubts about the meaning of its existence, quickly find themselves with no questions left, once space and skies are illuminated by the myriad of transfixing plasma lights.",,,,

vic_cocytus,CUSTOM,"Arguably one of the most extensive and expensive private terraforming projects ever conducted prior to the Collapse. Turned from a lifeless rock into a sprawling garden to serve not only as the new corporate headquarters but also as the top management's ""vacation paradise"", Cocytus is the current home to the infamous Volkov Industrial Conglomerate, which gained nigh-full ownership of it and the rest of the system thanks to yet another shady deal with the Domain and the obligation of supporting colonization and development of the Persean Sector.

Its endless summer and sandy beaches, thriving biosphere and warm oceans, picturesque golden sunsets and never-sleeping island megapolises make it one of the most idyllic and desirable planets to live on in the entire Sector according to some, putting it on par with the dedicated ""Pleasure planets"" of the pre-Collapse times.",,"From a first glance, time seems to have stopped in this place. Apart from the fact that a portion of the ocean and land have been given over to agricultural industries to feed the Empyrean system, and that the population has become much more ""diverse"" thanks to the widespread use of the genetech, Cocytus mostly remains the same just as prior to the Collapse. The rich and mafia leaders feast and indulge in exotic activities in their mansions by artificial waterfalls and lagoons to the sound of birdsong, white-collar workers continue to build financial charts in ultra-composite skyscrapers, and everyone else just continue to live and work for both their own and the common good in the hope of a bright future promised to them by both the government and the PR Department. Even if it means spending most of their lives on busy factories and farms. 

This may not be the most well-known fact, but Cocytus does indeed have its own government. Restructured by the combined efforts of the local authorities, the military, and the Conglomerate almost immediately after the Collapse to stabilize the situation, the Persean Union of Domain Colonies formally governs both the entire Empyrian Star System and the colonies outside of it, which voluntarily or voluntarily-forcibly join the Union thanks to the Conglomerate's endeavours. Of course, the formal side of the issue and the real state of affairs are strikingly different, but as long as VIC exists and strives, the Union is left to manage the civilian matters.",,
vic_purgatory,CUSTOM,"Another terraforming project which, unlike Cocytus, went terribly wrong soon after the Collapse and the ""Jump Point Accident,"" due to the lack of resources required for the terraforming process to continue properly. However, instead of completely abandoning the doomed world, VIC seized the opportunity and reorganised the infrastructure to fit into a new role.

These days the inhospitable Purgatory is where the Conglomerate's armies are being made and trained, as well as where the most important research facilities are located, with the biomaterial being brought in practically non-stop by both the corporation's expeditionary fleets and the contracted freelancers. With some of the latter occasionally being mentioned and seen among the less lawful parts of the Sector's population.",,"Atagara BioTech's new headquarters are impressive indeed. In the worst sense of the word. Hiding behind acid clouds, networks of test sites and research centers stretch across the swampy surface of a lifeless world, in which countless employees in bright white coats are trying to uncover the secrets of life and the universe. Most of the theories and new technologies are tested on xenoflora and xenofauna collected by the Conglomerate across the Sector. And on whatever that is considered and branded as such by the researchers themselves.",,
vic_phlegethon,CUSTOM,"Ever since Explorarium probes sent back their first data about the not-yet-named-then Empyrean system, Phlegethon has attracted a lot of attention due to its impressive mineral deposits. However, it was only with the arrival of VIC and the launch of ""Archangel"" that it became possible to quickly break through the hard crust and extract resources within the superheated planet.

As the headquarters of the VIC Extractor Corps, Phlegethon accommodates tens of thousands of miners (both volunteer workers and convict debtors) and continuously supplies materials to the giant orbital shipyards hidden in the shadow behind the planet, where they are used to assemble the Conglomerate's ships.",,"As odd as it may seem, the Conglomerate pays handsomely to the contract workers at its main mining colony. Difficult working conditions, huge risks to health and life in general, the inability of early termination of the contract - work at Phlegeton requires considerable endurance (both physical and mental) and a willingness to spend several years of your life in a place that can be called hell in all fairness.

It's not surprising though, that the managers who make sure the giant mining and processing plants continue to operate and churn out valuable resources, do not like to mention that the corporation's current wage policy and tolerance towards labour unions were not established until after a couple of dozen worker riots in other Sectors.",,
vic_archangel,CUSTOM,"The pride of VIC, and a true technological marvel, the ""Archangel"" mining station, positioned in the Lagrange Point between Empyrean and Phlegethon, concentrates the supergiant's light with the help of enormous Reflector Arrays™ and produces what could possibly be one the most devastating laser beams in the Sector. 

Scraping off Phlegeton's useless exterior crust, ""Archangel"" allows the miners to easily access exposed minerals and collect them by more conventional means. Thankfully, this is the only practical application the station is capable of, and the one it was initially built for. At least,  this is the case according to official Conglomerate statements. ",,"Before you can approach the awe-inducing orbital contraption, piercing the magmatic planet with its sword of light, your ship systems start almost literally screaming - reports of several hundred targeting lasers start flowing in, and you have to bring your fleet to a halt. In less than a minute an incoming transmission from the enormous orbital station is finally heard:

""Attention, citizen. This is Volkov Industrial Conglomerate's property and this area is OFF LIMITS to all unauthorized personnel. Turn around and leave, or you will be terminated. Thank you for your cooperation.""

The voice is strict and commanding, and this certainly does not feel like a joke. Judging by the size of the station, it's possible that it holds enough defensive weaponry to stand its ground against whole armadas. You decide that is indeed best to leave. ",,
vic_megaera,CUSTOM,"Once a regional Domain military base, nowadays this cold place serves as a junkyard, a recycling facility, and an AM-fuel factory for the Conglomerate and the Union. Harsh climate, boring routine and isolating distance from the capital make Megaera a perfect place for ""screw-up"" subordinates to be sent to for prolonged business trips.

Before all the valuable equipment and personnel were relocated to other planets by the Conglomerate during the post-Collapse restabilization period, this particular base was quite well-known among the Domain military higher-ups for its soldiers and special forces units, who demonstrated evidently inhuman physical and intellectual abilities during both their training and service. 
",,"Ironically called the ""Party Place"", the rocky Megaera eventually brings depression or apathy to any and all of its residents, even the most sanguine ones. Surface hub complexes located in the windless and geothermally active regions of the uneven icy landscape, although providing satisfactory living conditions and even some forms of entertainment, still cannot compare with the megacities of Cocytus, the dreamy talks about which do not subside for a minute in these gloomy cold places.",,
vic_fortuna,CUSTOM,"An inconspicuous planet whose low profile has made it a desirable target for some.

By the look of the clumping living quarters hubs and shabby hangars amidst and inside the craters and canyons, one can easily say that they were built precisely taking into account the risk of yet another space rock striking right at them.

vic_jump_point_stabilizer,CUSTOM,"An extremely complex device capable of stabilizing hyperspace Jump Points by exploiting convoluted quantum processes too inextricable for all but the most experienced physicists of the current era. It is with the help of these devices that VIC's prolonged period of total isolation was ended in c+202.

Potential results of using this technology on the stable working Jump Points are still being actively debated among the Sector's scientific community. ",,"The weird contraptions, circling around the jump point, emit an eerie low hum. At first, you can't even understand, how it's possible, considering the vacuum between you and them. Only then the realization comes to you - what some commoners would call ""the very fabric of the universe"" is slightly vibrating itself all around the enigmatic machines, making you feel somewhat sick.

vic_kalada,CUSTOM,"A formerly independent colony which became the first newly acquired asset of VIC after the corporation's sudden resurgence. Despite the initial rioting, the local populace is beginning to slowly accept the regime that was brought in by the new supervisors. After all, with the steadily increasing quality of life, it becomes harder to deny that the Conglomerate does indeed care about the prosperity of its own people. Or, at least, those who have enough to afford that prosperity.

However, not everyone accepts the current situation, with a vigilante resistance group, the ""Kaladian Swordsmen,"" becoming increasingly prominent and popular among the opposition forces, much to the displeasure of VIC's newly-appointed planetary managers. ",,"The timely accidental disbanding of the ruling coalition of local states and the ensuing conflicts allowed the Conglomerate to justifyingly proceed with the peacekeeping operation and make it quick and moderately bloodless. A series of betrayals and backstabbings among the regional regimes, several small military campaigns to take over the coastal water treatment systems and food mixture factories, and Kalada's oasis cities found themselves on a silver platter of the Conglomerate, all too ready to save the population from the chaos and join the dry world to the Union. The corporation and the newly estabished government (with some old faces from the previous regimes), however, still had to spend some time and money to rebuild wind farms and irrigation systems, some of which were damaged in the short-term civil war. Which made it possible to slightly alleviate discontent both among the local population and the foreign observers of the conflict.",,
vic_mithos,CUSTOM,"This not-so-important dusty colony of the Church of Galactic Redemption took on a second life after the news of VIC's return began to spread, especially soon after the occupation of Kalada.

Considered the main front of the war against evil, the planet is currently experiencing an economic and demographic boom, with the supporters of the Luddic Church from all over the Sector swarming to it in hopes that one day they'll get to break the hungry jaw of the Conglomerate and drive this Luciferian monstrosity from the past back into the pits of inferno, from whence it seemingly came.

vic_pyktis,CUSTOM,"After the end of the Second AI war, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation was faced with a serious need to re-establish its sphere of influence.

It doesn't matter who Boe is. The only thing that does matter, is that the local trade convoys are not happy at all. And that the beer at the bar is some of the best in the whole system.

quasar,PLANET,"One of the most luminous, massive and electromagnetically ""loud"" objects in the known Universe, quasars, also known as quasi-stellar objects, are enormous black holes, the accretion disks of which are heated up due to the friction, which causes them to emit up to 600 trillion times as much light as the Sun. A part of matter and energy concentrated around quasars is emitted outwards in giant jets, obliterating everything in their path. A terrifying, yet magnificent wonder of the Universe. 

While not actually being a proper quasar (which can be naturally encountered only at the centres of galaxies), this particular stellar entity possessed enough similar traits for the Sector's scientific community to classify it as one.
