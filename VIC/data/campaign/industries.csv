Pleasant climate and developed infrastructure for recreation and leisure attract visitors from all corners of the Sector. Or at least those who are willing to turn a blind eye to the reputation of the Conglomerate for the sake of luxury hotels, wild night parties and other, more specific and exotic types of entertainment.",

Formally owned by Atagara BioTech, ""Chimera"" Biolabs are looking for the new ways to manipulate life, as well as improving the old ones. All the soldiers of the megacorporation arrive here for training and modernization sooner or later, but not all of them end up suitable for further service, especially when it comes to the most novel, experimental solutions.",

Yet with just a little bit of creativity and a few questionable modifications, it is possible to push life even further, beyond its usual boundaries. 

The majority of such rampant alterations were created (and, of course, copyrighted) by ""Chapelle & Telgenhof Co."" - one of the more profitable agricultural corporations of the Domain.

Interestingly enough, just like back then, the modified organisms require a constant supply of surprisingly specific DNA-calibrating treatments to stay alive and productive. The treatments provided exclusively by the Conglomerate.  ",200

Generous compensations are offered to attract volunteers for research and testing. Perhaps, even too generous.",250

By providing recommendations for containment, procedure for handling infection of essential workers, and plans to mitigate long term effects, the effects of EVC on the colony are reduced. A steady supply of raw bio materials and trained staff are required to carry out the board's instructions",205

Local officials play a key role in managing containment, following directives from the centralized Biohazard system enabling rapid responses to outbreaks and carefully managed quarantined zones. While a drain on a colonial economy, this centralized facility does enable significant reduction in the negative effects of EVC.",205

Carefully curated genetic anti-virals are given to all colonial workers every month with outbreaks being contained with ruthless efficiency. The personalized genetic treatments and colonial wide contamination procedures are very costly but are considered worth it by the local populace in order to lead semi-normal lives.",205
